# Mercator Crawler

Provides a URL-frontier, MetaData fetcher, URL Deduper, and is very plug and play friendly ðŸ˜„

## URL Frontier

A URL Frontier's job is to provide preference and politeness.

## Metadata fetcher

Fetches general info about a given url.

## URL Deduper

This isn't the technical term, but it basically allows you to stop duplicate urls from entering the URL Frontier at the same time.
